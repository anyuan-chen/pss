                  Public Schools Speech Organization (PSSO) is a community
                  organization led by students with a passion for public
                  speaking. PSSO was created on the foundation that public
                  speaking should be accessible to everyone. Currently, the
                  public speaking community is dominated by private school
                  students who are able to gain competitive advantages through
                  exclusive access to resources and connections. PSSO works to
                  bridge the gap between public school students and the world of
                  public speaking. We share our knowledge and experience with
                  students across the Greater Toronto Area to help students find
                  their voice.
